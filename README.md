### ADDITIONAL CHANGES/FEATURES:
Bootstrapped with React and Typescript, I spent roughly 20 hours completing this challenge. I would like to thank you for the application opportunity, I had a lot of fun throughout the whole process and hope you enjoy my work as well! Here are some changes I made and extra features I implemented:

- Implemented a sorting filter for icdCode lengths, defaults to highest to lowest but can be toggled to lowest to highest
- Extending sorting by adding an ascending/descending alphabetical sort button, can also be toggled
- Used Framer Motion for a cleaner UX: incorporated subtle hover animations, animated the "Back" Button and created smooth transitions between ParticipantList and ParticipantFocusView screens
- Implemented a loading screen spinner animations
- Cleaned up styling with individual components
- Changed the icdCode constant to a map with the corresponding medical conditions due to difficulties getting the server to connect with the Clinical Table Search Service API
